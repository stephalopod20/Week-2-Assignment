    <h1>About</h1>

<p>What's a guy to do about all those end bits and pieces of wax from leftover candles? Seems like the answer is
   often "dispose of properly". But Googling "proper disposal of used candle wax" ultimately leads to weird DIY projects, 
   or just throwin' 'em in the trash. What gives? They mostly just want to make sure you aren't dumping melty candle wax 
   down your drains.</p>

<p>I want to care more about the things I bring into and out of my home. Therefore, I'm conducting the shallowest possible Google research to see what else we can do with the extra wax. Please see our "Contact" page
    to contribute your opinions and experiences!</p>

<h4><p>So, what do?</p></h4>

    <li>Throw away, further contributing to global waste issues.</li>
    <li>Keep forever, further contributing to global waste issues but later down the line.</li>
</ul>
<p>Certainly, we can do better! Surely we can find an easier solution than launching the garbage into space. That doesn't exist, anyway. <i>Yet.</i> Oh no!
