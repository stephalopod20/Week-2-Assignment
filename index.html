    <h5>Welcome to Waxperiment!</h5>
    <p>Recently, I've been trying to be more aware of the trash I generate. I know it is important to reuse, made popular
    by the adage "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle". That left me with a problem: too many mostly-empty jars
    which used to house old candles and desperately needed a new use. Cue my only idea: using the last bits of wax in my oil burner!
    </p>
    <br>

<figcaption><i>Reused old candle wax in an oil burner. The scent has run out. Now what?</i></figcaption>
<br>
<p>So then I'm faced with a similarly maddening dilemma: what do I do with <i>that</i> leftover wax?</p>
<br>
<table>
    <tr><font size=5>Some Thoughts on Reusing Candle Wax</tr></font>
        <th>Option 1</th>
        <th>Option 2</th>
        <th>Option 3</th>
    <tr>
        <td>Melt it all into a new candle with a new wick (ensuring it's not a toxic wick, or toxwick)</td>
        <td>Add tons more essential oil</td>
        <td>Beg for candle companies to instill a take-back program to reuse their own jars and/or wax!</td>
        </tr>
</table><br>

<p>Lucky for us, thanks to Option 3, I know of at least one local brand that does this!</p><br>
